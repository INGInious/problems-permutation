# Permutation task

This is a side project to test UI/UX from different packages for the students task view of a permutation problem.
Webpack is used to generate bundles of js files that will be then imported by the main project.

## Test environment
Using npm:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Using yarn:
```
yarn install
yarn run start
```

## Type checking with flow
Using npm
```
npm run-script flow
```
Using yarn:
```
yarn run flow
```

## Production build
Using npm:
```
npm install
npm run-script build
```
Using yarn:
```
yarn install
yarn run build
```
This command will create a bundle file inside the plugin static file structure.
